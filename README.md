This is a simple project using undirected graphs. The user should be able to see games with a certain tag, inspect the game and inspect its other tags.

The user interacts with the data via a text-based menu.
When running the program, they are presented with 3 choices:
1 - View categories, which prints all available tags to the console
2 - View games, which prints all available games to the console
3 - Search, which has 2 functionalities:
    i. Search by category, where the user is prompted for a pattern to look for in the available tags (this pattern is not case-sensitive). All matches will be indexed and displayed to the console. The user can done choose a tag via its index in order to find games with that tag.
    ii. Search in games, where a user is similarly asked for a pattern and shown all matches in the console. The user can then choose a game and be presented with all recorded details of that game, as well as be shown suggestions (or games with similar tags).
